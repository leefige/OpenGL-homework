# Assignment 3: Planet rotates around sun

1) Setting the orbits, sizes and textures of planets (no need to be same as real scale).

2) Add keyboard control. E.g., press â†’ key to increase the rotation speed along the x-axis

3) Add text besides planet. Planets move with names.

Note: planets and texts can use different shaders, you can calculate the position of planets on screen and pass to RenderText function (Tutorial 6 code)
